## Game information

A turn-based, low-poly isometric rougelite. The player plays through 5 punishing levels, each level containing new enemies and eventually traps and random events. The player progresses through each level, gaining experience for each kill they get, which can then be spent in the skill shop.

The player must use their abilities carefully and ensure strategic movement in order to survive each level. The player has the power of possession, allowing the player to possess and enemy sometimes throughout the levels which can be used strategically to move the possessed enemy away or attack other enemies.

All while doing this, the player needs to remain aware of their health, current stamina, and sanity. If sanity drops too low, the player may have more issues to deal with...

Game features 4~ unique buildings, 17 unique enemies, and 2 unique traps. In addition to this, the simple fog of war, A* algorithm for shortest pathing, turn-based logic, and post-processing effects. Custom music and art for UI elements were also implemented.

For performance, occlusion culling and object pooling are in use.
